# Aredn Angular UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5. It is designed to serve as a new / alternative frontend for the AREDN project.

## Requirements to run locally

1) NodeJS (10+ is preferable)
2) An accessible Aredn node for API requests.

## First setup

After installing NodeJS and cloning this repository run the command.

`> npm install`

You can get then follow the instructions below.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The code expects an Areden node to be running at http://localnode.local.mesh:8080, as defined in the proxy.conf.json file at the root of the project.
This allows the front-end project to make API requests to the localnode as if the frontend were actually running on the node itself.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
